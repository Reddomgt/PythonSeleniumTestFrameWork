        This script automates a series of actions using Selenium WebDriver with Chrome browser, including:

        1. Navigating to the specified URL.
        2. Interacting with elements such as buttons, links, and input fields.
        3. Adding a specific product (Blackberry) to the cart.
        4. Proceeding to checkout and filling out the form to complete the purchase.
        5. Verifying the success message upon successful form submission.

        The path to the ChromeDriver is fetched from the environment variable 'CHROMEDRIVER_PATH', which allows flexibility in specifying the path based on the user's system configuration.

        Usage:
        - This test is useful for automating shopping cart interactions, form submissions, and verifying success messages in a web application.
