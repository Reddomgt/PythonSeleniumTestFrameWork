    Adds a custom command-line option to the pytest framework.

    This function allows the user to specify the browser name to be used during testing
    by adding a `--browser_name` option to the pytest command-line interface. If no value
    is provided, the default browser is set to "chrome".

    This pytest fixture sets up a WebDriver instance for browser automation based on the browser name 
    provided via command-line options. It supports Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers. The corresponding 
    driver paths are retrieved from environment variables. The fixture initializes the browser, navigates 
    to a specified URL, and assigns the WebDriver instance to the test class. After the test execution, 
    the browser is closed.
    Args:
        request: A pytest request object that provides access to the test context, including command-line options.
    Yields:
        None: The fixture yields control back to the test, and cleanup (browser closure) is performed after the test.
